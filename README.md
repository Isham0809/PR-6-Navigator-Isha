# Project Working
  - Core Feature
      1. Route Management:
         - The application allows users to define and manage multiple routes.
         - Provides tools for visualizing and editing routes dynamically.

      2. Dynamic Rendering:
           - Renders route-related components based on user interaction and configuration.
      
      3. Responsive Design:
           - Ensures the application is accessible and functional across various devices and screen sizes.
      
      4. Performance Optimization:
           - Utilizes Vite for efficient builds and faster development workflow.
      
      5. Authentication:
          - Provides secure login and registration functionalities for users.
          - Ensures access control by protecting routes based on user roles and authentication status.

      6. Product Details Functionality:
          - Allows users to view detailed information about individual products.
          - Displays product images, descriptions, specifications, and pricing.
          - Includes interactive elements like adding products to a cart or wishlist.
          - Supports dynamic updates to reflect changes in product availability or pricing.

# Authentication Details
Navbar Links
  - Dynamic Links:
    - The navbar updates dynamically based on the user's authentication status.
    - Authenticated users see personalized links (e.g., Dashboard, Logout), while unauthenticated users see options like
        Login and Register.

  - Protected Links:
    - Certain links (e.g., Profile, Settings) are accessible only to authenticated users.
    - Unauthenticated users attempting to access these links are redirected to the login page.

Registration
  1. User Registration:
     - New users can register by providing a username, email, and password.
     - Passwords are securely hashed before storage to ensure data protection.

  2. Validation:
     - Form inputs are validated on both the client and server sides to prevent invalid data submissions.

  3. Feedback:
     - Users receive feedback for successful registrations or errors (e.g., email already in use).

Login
  1. User Login:
     - Existing users can log in using their email and password.
     - Upon successful authentication, a token is issued to maintain the session.

  2. Session Management:
     - Sessions are maintained securely using HTTP-only cookies or token-based storage (e.g., JWT).

  3. Error Handling:
     - Users are notified of incorrect credentials or account issues (e.g., unverified email).

Logout
  - Session Termination:
    - Users can log out securely, which invalidates their session token.
    - Redirects to the home or login page after logout.
